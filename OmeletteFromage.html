			Ingredients:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>
			<li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (Gruyere, Cheddar or Swiss)</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
			<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>hopped fresh herbs (optional)</li>

		</ul>
		<p>Directions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Crack the eggs into a small mixing bowl and whisk them together with a fork until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
			<li>Add the shredded cheese to the eggs and stir until the cheese is evenly distributed.</li>
			<li>Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan to coat the bottom.</li>
			<li>Once the butter has melted and starts to foam, pour in the egg and cheese mixture. Use a spatula to spread the mixture evenly over the bottom of the pan.</li>
			<li>Let the omelette cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges start to set and the bottom is lightly browned.</li>
			<li>Use the spatula to fold the omelette in half and let it cook for another 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the cheese has melted and the eggs are fully cooked.</li>
			<li>Slide the omelette onto a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Sprinkle with chopped fresh herbs (if using) and serve immediately.</li>
